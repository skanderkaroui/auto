## Project Log

<ins>*July 15, 2024*</ins>: **_new direction_** \
as i'm facing issues with integrating what i've built into a meeting platform, i will be
creating a responsive chatbot and sell it as a product.

takeaway: do good research before building a tool or you'll end up wasting your time.


<ins>*July 10, 2024*</ins>: **_auto v0_** \
in order to test out the voice function, I finally made a working version that takes the 
voice passes it to Faster Whisper for speech to text synthesis and then passes the text
to OpenAI API, and then takes the text generated by the API to transform it to voice.

<ins>*Jun 25, 2024*</ins>: **_start of a journey_**\
the idea is to build an extension
designed to be integrated with an existing meeting platform in order to talk to a bot
inside the meetings.
